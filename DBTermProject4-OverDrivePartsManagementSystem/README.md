1. What you need to run this app:
    python3 (Tested with python 3.6)
    python flask (pip install Flask)

2. Go into project folder (the place where you opened this README.md file)

   If you are a windows user, type in:
       "set FLASK_APP=app.py"
       "set FLASK_DEBUG=1"
       "flask db init"
       "flask db migrate"
       "flask db upgrade"
       "flask run" (if does not work, try to change your port by "flask run -p 3000")
       Then open the URL in your browser, it will tell you you need some extra pachages, just pip install them until you get into the website. 
   If you are a linux user, change the "set" with "export", all the other remains the same.
